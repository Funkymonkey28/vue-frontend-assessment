Bugs I encountered:
- don't forget to put type='button' in button tags. Otherwise the button won't work properly
	- Maybe not?? This conflicts with the incorrect input notification. Got rid of the type, and now both work? 
		Perhaps the whole custom Modal needs to sit outside the form?
- If using multiple click events, put a @click.stop after the outer most @click to stop it from effecting the 
    inner divs. Otherwise only the outermost @click works
- emits: [ 'switch-to-profile' ] <--- this needs to be included in the script to avoid the "event has been 
	triggered but not decalred on 'emits' option" error. https://fjolt.com/article/vue-emit
- overflow-auto <-- use this on the parent element that is being overflowed
