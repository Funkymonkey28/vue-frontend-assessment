Bugs I encountered:
- don't forget to put type='button' in button tags. Otherwise the button won't work properly
	- Maybe not?? This conflicts with the incorrect input notification. Got rid of the type, and now both work? 
		Perhaps the whole custom Modal needs to sit outside the form?
- If using multiple click events, put a @click.stop after the outer most @click to stop it from effecting the 
    inner divs. Otherwise only the outermost @click works
- emits: [ 'switch-to-profile' ] <--- this needs to be included in the script to avoid the "event has been 
	triggered but not decalred on 'emits' option" error. https://fjolt.com/article/vue-emit

Cypress
- open using: npx cypress open
- can't find it / can't find describe
	-import '@types/jest'; into test file
- can' find cy 
	- run (either one or all of these. Can't remember. Probably the first one):
		- npm install --save-dev webpack typescript ts-loader
		- npm i -D @types/jest ts-jest jest
		- npm i -D @types/mocha mocha
	- add "types": ["cypress"] to the compilerOptions in tsconfig.json
- can't find it / can't find describe / can' find cy 
	- add 'plugin:cypress/recommended', to .eslintrc.js
vue setup
- npm install vue
- npm install -g @vue/cli 
- npm install vue-router
